I am a sophomore student at the University of Science and Technology of
China. I was admitted to the School of the Gifted Young in 2024 when I was 16.
I major in mathematics, and currently I’m a member of the Hua Loo-Keng
Talent Program in Mathematics. Furthermore, I would like to study probability,
statistics, and machine learning. I am passionate about gaining knowledge and
conducting undergraduate research, especially in Maths.
